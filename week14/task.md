1.What does the scaffold model say?
working memory is weak, associations are built by repetition, long term memory strong,
items with many associations less likely to be forgotten

2.List Nielsens principles 
visibility of systems status
Match between system and real world
User Control and Freedom
consistency and standards
error prevention
recoginition rather than recall
flexibility and efficiency of use
aesthetic and minimalist design
help users with errors
help and docs

3.List 3 usability methods
cognitive walkthrough
surveys 
prototyping

4.explain 3 harmonic relationships between nielsens principles
visibility of system status and help with errors
by explaining to the user faulty states or inputs the user understands the system status 
and by making the system status visible it helps the user understand what might cause problems for the system.

recoginition rather than recall and minimalist deisgn
making options to user visible to reduce cognitive load demands the systems architect of making priorities to ensure not too many options are displayed which would confuse or overwhelm the user, which leads to a minimalist design. Also a minimalsit design well done, takes pressure of users cognitive load which relies on recognition rather than recall

consistency and standards and flexibility and efficiency of use
standards make it easier to learn a system which leads to efficient use



5.Explain one relationship between two or more principels that might be conflicting
Usre control and flexibility and error prevention. The more user control the more potential for software misuse is there  and thus more possible errors there are to anticipate, hence its more difficult to avoid errors.


6.What are potential benefits or cognitive walkthroughs?  
oen might spot pain points in the customer journey which could lead to dissatisfaction
it also can lead to spotting potential misuse of the software

7.For gender-mag walkthroughs why is a persona needed?
Persona gives a context of behaviours thus shrinking the amount of possible actiosn at any given point in time, if absent one would need to anticipate every possible action a human could take. With personas testers can focus on specific target audiences
