requirements own thoughts:

fundamentally we can make certain assumptions about users when building software:

    Users are going to interact with Software via a machine typically a computer with mouse and keyboard.
    Users can perceive language and shapes.
    Users interact in some way to achive a result ( with mouse or keyboard)

from this , user stories should ideally be in the format of :

action â†’ Result

example: I want to click a button which shows me my profile

why might this format be better? 

example User: I want to send emails to friends

application: User needs to first invite someone to their house, the friend loggs in into their software, then user can send emails to that person


imporoved version:
User: I want to write the name of a friend and then click a button to send a letter

way less ambiguity about the users expectations, this example might be exagerated but illustrates the issue with user stories
